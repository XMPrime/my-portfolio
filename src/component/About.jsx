                    I highly value teamwork and cooperation. That said, I want
                    to be a good fit within the company culture. Below are some
                    of my favorite interests and hobbies. Hopefully there's some
                    overlap!

                      <p>
                        Learning to code has really changed the way I see
                        self-fulfillment. Having the ability to build stuff for
                        myself and others to use is both fun and challenging!

                        Terraforming Mars, Castles of Mad King Ludwig, and The

                        I'm always down to play anything!

                      <p>
                        I mostly play D&D 5<sup>th</sup> edition and currently
                        DM for a Ghosts of Saltmarsh campaign. I've also dabbled
                        in Pathfinder and FFG's Star Wars RPG. I would love to
                        try and learn other systems!

                      <p>
                        Or as I like to call it, solving puzzles with your body!
                        The exercise just happens to be a nice bonus. Climbing
                        is great because your progression is always clearly in
                        view (literally and figuratively).
